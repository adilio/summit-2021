### Talk Summary

As more and more organizations adopt a DevOps methodology, the importance of selecting a Configuration Management tool becomes paramount. Three CM tools that have separated themselves for the pack are Puppet, Ansible, and DSC. Each tool brings its own flavor of deployment, state maintenance, and idempotence. But which tool is right for your organization? As with most things, this depends largely on your individual environment and use case. This talk will give an overview of all three tools, and highlight the advantages and things to watch out for with each approach.
